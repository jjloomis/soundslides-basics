# Creating a Soundslides project

1. Open Soundslides and click the `New` button.
2. In the Save dialog box, give your project a relevant name. Follow [file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html). 
3. Click the `expand` button \(downward-pointing arrow\) next to the Save As field to display additional storage locations. 
4. In the left panel under Shared, select ufiles.ad.uwm.edu. Navigate to your class folder.
5. Click `Save`. Sounslides will display a screen with import buttons and project setting. Leave the default settings selected.
6. Click the `JPG` button. Navigate to and select your keeper-pics folder. Click `Open`. Note: At this point, Soundslides will import the entire folder of JPG files. Individual JPG files will be appear greyed out. This is because the folder is the item being imported into the program. 
7. Click `SLIDE SHOW ONLY - SKIP AUDIO`. \(You can add audio later.\)
8. After Soundslides loads and your JPG files are imported, click `Save`.
