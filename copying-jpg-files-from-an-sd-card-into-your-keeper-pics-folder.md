# Copying JPG files into your keeper-pics folder

## From an SD card

1. Eject the SD card from your camera. Insert the SD card into the Mac's SD card reader (back of the Mac).
2. On the Mac, iPhoto will open. Do not use iPhoto to manage your JPG files. Close iPhoto.
3. On the Desktop, the SD card will appear as an attached device (on the right). Double-click the SD card to open it. 
4. In the SD card's Finder window, you will need to drill down in the folder tree to find your JPG files. (The location of the folder of JPG files will be different for each camera manufacturer.) 
5. In the folder of JPG files, press Command + A (on keyboard) to select all of the JPG files in the folder. 
6. With all of the JPG files selected, press Control (on keyboard) and click within the selected area. In the fly-out menu that appears, select Open With and choose Preview.
7. If necessary, open another Finder window and navigate to your keeper-pics folder.
8. In Preview, select the thumbnails (right panel) of the JPG files you'd like to use in your project. Note: Press the Command key (on keyboard) to select multiple thumbnails.
9. Click and drag the selected thumbnails into your keeper-pics folder. 
10. When finished, eject your SD card and insert it back into your camera.
