# Copying JPG files from a USB drive into your keeper-pics folder

1. Connect your USB drive to a JAMS Lab or CCL Mac.
2. On the Desktop, your USB drive will appear as an attached device (on the right). Double-click your USB drive to open it.
3. In the USB drive's Finder window, navigate to the folder that contains the JPG files you'd like to use in your project.

    * If the folder contains JPG files and other files (MOV or DOCX files, for example), press Command (on keyboard) and select only the JPG files.
 
    * If the folder contains only JPG files, press Command + A (on keyboard) to select all of the JPG files.

6. With all of the JPG files selected, press Control (on keyboard) and click within the selected area. In the fly-out menu that appears, select Open With and choose Preview.
7. If necessary, open another Finder window and navigate to your keeper-pics folder.
8. In Preview, select the thumbnails (right panel) of the JPG files you'd like to use in your project. Press the Command key (on keyboard) to select multiple thumbnails.
9. Click and drag the selected thumbnails into your keeper-pics folder.
10. When finished, eject your USB drive and remove it from the back of the Mac.
