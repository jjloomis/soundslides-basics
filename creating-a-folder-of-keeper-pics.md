# Creating a keeper pics folder

1. If necessary, connect to your class folder using a [JAMS Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-jams-lab.html) or [CCL](/(https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-ccl.html) Mac.
2. [Drill down in the folder tree](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) until you are in your class folder.
3. Press `Control` \(on keyboard\) and click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select `New Folder`.
4. Name the new folder `keeper-pics-[project-name]`. Replace `[project-name]` with a relevant project name. Follow [file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html).
